This work explores the application of the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm for the analysis of public support for democracy using panel data. The peculiarity about the data is its sparsity. Therefore, the literature until [@Claassen2019estimating; @Claassen2020support; @Claassen2020mood] has only studied a small subset of the data either restricted by a small number of countries or time periods. @Claassen2019estimating, however, shows how to use the MH algorithm together with the sparse data to create a dense dataset. [@Claassen2020support; @Claassen2020mood] then analyzes this the dense dataset and draws important conclusion about the drivers and the implications of public support for democracy. The objective of this paper is to test the reliability of @Claassen2019estimating's approach. I approach this in two ways: First, I look at the sensitivity of the MH estimates towards changes in the number of iterations, the length of the warmup period, and the number of chains. Second, I compare the estimates' sensitivity towards updated data. I come to three results:
First, updating the dataset from 1997 to 2015 by three additional years lead to noticable changes in latent PSD. This raises the question whether the substantial findings in @Claassen2020mood and @Claassen2020support that rely on the MH estimates are reliable.
Second, Claassen's estimation is very inefficient because he uses an excessive amount of MCMC draws. This makes it hard to replicate and to build on his research.
Third, the number of chains does not have an effect and the warmup length is ideal at the value recommended by STAN. Therefore, there is not much added value to analyze the sensitivity of MH estimates towards changes in these tuning parameters.
