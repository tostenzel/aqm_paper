In recent years scholars have found declining support for democracy in long-established democracies. [@Norris2017; @Foa2016; @Foa2017; @Voeten2016; @Denemark2016]. This finding raises two important questions: First, what are the reasons for this decline, and second, what are its implications, i.e., does a decline in democratic support endanger the survival of democracy?

A series of recent articles [@Claassen2019estimating; @Claassen2020support; @Claassen2020mood] researches these questions and presents novel results. Regarding the first question, @Claassen2020support finds -- in contrary to the the widely held belief of self-reinforcing democracies -- that democratic support naturally fluctuates over time. The reasons is that increases in democracy levels lead to decreases in public support and vice versa. Regarding the second question, so far the results about the relationship between democratic support and its survival have been mixed. @Claassen2020support, however, finds supporting evidence for the natural theory that democratic support plays a positive role in the system's survival.

A main obstacle for researching democratic support is that current panel data contains a large number of missing values. @Claassen2019estimating finds an approach to deal with this problem by simulating dense panel data from the actual fractured data. The two most recent studies both rely on this simulated data. His approach consists of three steps: First, assume a probabilistic structural model of democratic support. Second, estimate its parameters via the Metropolis Hastings algorithm from the fractured data. Third, simulate new data using the model and the parameter estimates.

The objective of this work is to evaluate the robustness of Claassen's findings towards changes in the method's hyperparameters. In other words, I incorparate the uncertainty about the right choice of hyperparameters into Claassen's results to test their reliability. In particular, I propagate a random set of hyperparameters through Claassen's estimation procedure. This is important because arbitrary hyperparameter choices can potentially lead to false or at least random results. Therefore, the respective parametric uncertainty should always be reported along the point estimate.

I come to the following results:


The final paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature of public support with a focus on Claassen's papers, defines the concept and looks at the data. Section 3 explains Claassen's model of public support, its estimation and my approach for the uncertainty propagation. Section 4 presents the results and Section 5 discusses the findings. Section 6 concludes.
