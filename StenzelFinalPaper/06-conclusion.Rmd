This work explores the application of the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm for the analysis of public support for democracy using panel data. The peculiarity about the data is its sparsity. Therefore, the literature until [@Claassen2019estimating; @Claassen2020support; @Claassen2020mood] has only studied a small subset of the data that is either restricted to a small number of countries or time periods. @Claassen2019estimating, on the other hand, shows how to use the MH algorithm together with the sparse dataset to create an extensive dense dataset. @Claassen2020support and @Claassen2020mood then analyze the dense data and draw important conclusions about the drivers and the implications of public support for democracy. This work deals with two questions: First, how reliable is Claassen's method? And second, can we improve his method.

I come to three results:
First, updating the dataset from 1997 to 2015 by three additional years leads to noticeable changes in latent PSD. This finding questions the reliability of @Claassen2019estimating's approach and the substantial findings in @Claassen2020mood and @Claassen2020support. However, it would be important to not only look at the changes in the estimated model parameters but also to analyze how the addition of new data propagates to the main coefficients of the statistical models in @Claassen2020support and @Claassen2020mood.
Second, Claassen's estimation is inefficient because he uses an excessive amount of MCMC draws. This makes it hard to replicate and to build on his research. Therefore, it would be good research practice to find the minimal number of iterations by means of convergence tests for Markov chains.
Third, the number of chains does not have an effect and the warmup length is ideal at the value recommended by STAN. Therefore, it suffices to rely on STAN's default values as long as the Markov chains converge. In view of these findings, future research should extend the robustness checks in this work to the main results in @Claassen2020support and @Claassen2020mood. Furthermore, it appears questionable whether @Claassen2019estimating's approach should also be applied to other topics with a similar data availability.
