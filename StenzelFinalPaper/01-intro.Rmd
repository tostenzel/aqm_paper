In recent years scholars have found declining support for democracy in long-established democracies. [@Norris2017; @Foa2016; @Foa2017; @Voeten2016; @Denemark2016]. This finding raises two important questions: First, what are the reasons for this decline, and second, what are its implications, in particular, does a decline in democratic support endanger the survival of democracy?

A series of recent articles [@Claassen2019estimating; @Claassen2020support; @Claassen2020mood] researches these questions and presents novel results. Regarding the first question, @Claassen2020support finds -- in contrary to the widely held belief of self-reinforcing democracies -- that democratic support naturally fluctuates over time. The reasons is that increases in democracy levels lead to decreases in public support and vice versa. Regarding the second question, so far the results about the relationship between democratic support and its survival have been mixed. @Claassen2020support, however, finds supporting evidence for the natural theory that democratic support plays a positive role in the system's survival.

A main obstacle for researching democratic support is that current panel data contains a large number of missing values. @Claassen2019estimating develops an approach to deal with this problem by simulating dense panel data from the actual fractured data. The two most recent studies both rely on this simulated data. His approach consists of three steps: First, assume a probabilistic structural model of democratic support. Second, estimate its parameters via the Metropolis Hastings algorithm from the fractured data. Third, simulate new data using the model and the parameter estimates.

Claassen's method appears to be very powerful and could potentially be applied to many more topics for which panel data is sparse. However, it is noteworthy that he estimates a large number of parameters from the data that he has. This work's research questions thus are: How reliable is Claassen's method? And, can we improve his approach? I approach these questions the following way: First, I check the robustness of Claassen's results towards hyperparameter changes. This is important because arbitrary hyperparameter choices can potentially lead to false or at least arbitrary results. Second, I compare the results obtained from old data with the results from slightly updated data. If the results differ too much, this would suggest that the structural model overfits the data.

I come to the following results: First, updating the dataset by three additional years (about one tenth) changes the results noticeably. This finding suggests that Claassen's approach would still require more data for robust results. 
Second, Claassen uses too many iterations for his estimation procedure. By determining the minimal number of iterations necessary for convergence he could have saved about two third of the computation time. Not wasting too much computational resources is important for two reasons: First, it allows spending more time on further robustness checks,  and second, it makes it easier for other researchers to replicate and build upon past research. The third finding is that the default hyperparameters recommended by @Stan deliver the benchmark results with the smallest variation and don't have to be changed.

The final paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature of public support of democracy with a focus on Claassen's papers, defines the support concept and looks at the data. Section 3 explains Claassen's model, its estimation and my approach for the robustness checks. Section 4 presents the results and Section 5 discusses the findings. Section 6 concludes.
